# CertifyChain  

**CertifyChain** is a decentralized platform for **issuing and verifying academic certificates as NFTs (ERC-721)**.  
It provides **transparency, immutability, and traceability** thanks to **Ethereum, Somnia, and IPFS** technologies.

---

## 🚀 Technologies  

- **Frontend**: React + Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS  
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, ERC-721, Role-based access (Admin / Director / Student)  
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum compatible (EVM) + Somnia Network integration  
- **Storage**: IPFS + Pinata for decentralized file storage  
- **Wallets**: MetaMask / WalletConnect integration  
- **Somnia Integration**: High-performance blockchain for enhanced scalability and reduced gas fees  

---

## 🌐 Somnia Network Features  

- **High Throughput**: Capable of handling thousands of transactions per second  
- **Low Gas Fees**: Cost-effective certificate issuance and verification  
- **EVM Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing Ethereum tools  
- **Enhanced Security**: Advanced consensus mechanisms for certificate integrity  
- **Cross-chain Interoperability**: Bridge capabilities with other blockchain networks

## 🔑 User Roles  

- **Admin** → assigns roles and manages system permissions  
- **Director** → issues NFT certificates and manages academic records  
- **Student** → receives and validates their certificates

## ⚙️ Workflow  

1. Wallet connection and authentication  
2. Role detection → dynamic dashboard interface  
3. Certificate issuance (image + metadata stored on IPFS)  
4. NFT minting on blockchain (verifiable on Etherscan and Somnia explorers)  
5. Real-time verification and validation system

**CertifyChain** transforms the way academic certificates are issued and validated,  
leveraging the power of **Ethereum, Somnia Network, and IPFS** to ensure documents are:  

✔️ **Unique** - Each certificate is a one-of-a-kind NFT  
✔️ **Verifiable** - Instant verification through blockchain technology  
✔️ **Immutable** - Cannot be altered or falsified once issued  
✔️ **Decentralized** - No single point of failure or control  
✔️ **Scalable** - Powered by Somnia's high-performance infrastructure  
✔️ **Cost-effective** - Reduced gas fees through Somnia optimization
